# Word Statistics RU/EN/CN v0.2.0‑alpha

Pre‑release (alpha) focused on better lemmatization/segmentation accuracy, stable builds, and simpler installation.

## Highlights
- Russian/English: improved dictionary‑based lemmatization and normalization
- Chinese (ZH): deterministic Dictionary mode + possessive merging (…的), bigram merge, and 的‑normalization
- Fast single‑file bundle `main.js` via esbuild
- Cleaner repo: no compiled JS in `src`; `main.js` is no longer tracked in Git
- README: clearer BRAT and Manual install via Releases

## Compatibility
- Requires Obsidian ≥ 0.15.0
- Cross‑platform (Desktop/Mobile), `isDesktopOnly: false`

## Installation
- BRAT (recommended): add `HappyToy010101/obsidian-word-statistics-RU-EN-CN`
- Manual: download `plugin.zip` from this release and place files into `YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/word-statistics-ru-en-cn/`:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `main.js`
  - `styles.css`
  Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins.

## Verify quickly
- Open the statistics view (📊 ribbon icon)
- Run “Run Strict Test” in plugin settings to validate the reference poem (RU/EN/ZH)

## Known notes
- Chinese unique word counts allow a small tolerance (within the strict test), due to segmentation edge cases
- For large vaults, enable caching for speed

## Release contents
- `plugin.zip` — ready‑to‑install archive with `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css`, `README.md`, `versions.json`
